      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a web developer, green jacket in tote, eager to jump into the world of software engineering! </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised just outside of Music City a.k.a Nashville, TN.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Music will always be my first love, I started playing piano when I was four years old and have since picked up a few more stringed instruments to add to my repertoire. Aside from that, I have become obsessed with rock climbing and spend most of my free time outside on the cliffs.  </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would definately be working as a front end or back end developer for a climbing or outdoor magazine!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently I am living in Seattle! Aside from it being a giant tech hub, it is also in close proximity to the mountains where I love to play.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer simply because I am a problem solver. All my hobbies require some form of problem solving or critical thinking, and these are skills I wish to align into a career path. </p>
